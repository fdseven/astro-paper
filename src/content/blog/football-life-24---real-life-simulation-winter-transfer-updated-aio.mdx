### From minhanh158

1. Football Life 24 Season 23/24 Winter Transfers updated
   I tried to do as many winter transfers update as possible. Please understand that this is individual project, so obviously it cannot be 100% completed. Inform me if you see any significant transfer that has not been made yet, I’ll update it constantly.

2. Players apprearance & motions updated
   As usual, I try to simulate the look and movement of players as close to reality as possible. For the appearance, both physique & kit style are taken care of. Players’ motion such as dribbling, running, kicking & celebrating are updated, too. But it’s PES2021, so please don’t expect newest celebrations could be done. I can only try to use what the game already has.

   Please understand that everyone has his own faces pack. And many faces have different head size setting. So if you find a player with too big/small head, it means we use different faces. Just deactive the faces folder and adjust head setting yourself.

3. Team line-up & tactics
   To keep the game up to date & have better feeling to play, the line up and tactics of many teams are updated.

4. Real Competition Participants updated
   Thanks to @sercsinano, the game now can have real participants in major competition. For example Liverpool will play in UEL instead of UCL, and Man City will face Arsenal in Com Shield instead of Liverpool, etc.

    ### HOW TO INSTALL

1. Inside my download link you’ll find a folder with an EDIT file & 2 parts of livecpk.rar file. Just download them all.

2. Make sure to back up your EDIT file first, in case you don’t like my file, you can always go back to yours.
   Copy my EDIT file to where your EDIT file of the game located. Normally it’s …\Documents\KONAMI\eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE\2024\save

3. Extract the livecpk.rar, put everything in your livecpk folder in SiderAddons. Write these lines in your sider.ini:

   ```ini
   // sider.ini
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\Accessories_2"
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\boot-Add-On_20-01"
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\boot-Add-On"
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\boot-root"
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\boot-root_12.5"
   cpk.root = ".\livecpk\Real competition"
   ```

   If you use any Menu Server, make sure the cpk.root = ".\livecpk\Real competition" line is written under the lines of Menu Server, so it won’t affect your Menu Screens.

   I accidentally include the F4L_REALISTIC_GAMEPLAY in the livecpk.rar. You can ignore it, and should follow Football4Life gameplay thread for more information. His gameplay is highly recommended.

  ## Another gameplay mod update for #PES2021 by Football4Life. This gameplay can provide a lot of enjoyment to everyone

The features of this gameplay Football4Life Realistic V1.5:

1. A very fluid and enjoyable arcade game,
2. Lots of beautiful actions and even more beautiful goals,
3. Responsive players with whom you can do feints and dribbles with enjoyment,
4. Smart AI
5. Players are very aware of the ball
6. Great mod for playing PvP, and PvCPU,
7. A enjoyable game both on default controls and on FUMA (I love how the shot on manual works),
8. Very welcome to players coming from FIFA and even better to those who loved the good old PES 6.
9. Great player rating system
10. For those users who do not have experience with FL23 or FL24 default foul system, ie for those who do not know how to play a clean game, and take the ball without tackling, you will need time to get used to it. If you have trouble making too much fouls, please check some 'PES tutorial' videos on YouTube on how to do it, and practice will make it much better.

### NOTE

- Tested only on FL24!!! Unfortunately, Football4Life almost 100% sure that the PES users will not be able to see what we see.
- Please follow the detailed installation instructions. If fouls don't work for you, or you have some other problems, you made a mistake somewhere during the installation.
- If you feel that the game speed is a bit fast, or slow for your taste, I also give you a 'Speed server' with the help of which you can fine-tune the gameplay speed using Sider. Inside the folder, you can see my detailed instructions on how to install, and how to use it. It is very simple.

### Improvements

V1.5 Improvements:

- Fixed bug where the player starts running without the ball.
- Improved fatigue system. In short - players will get a bit less tired than in the previous versions and in general the system is a little more balanced, what will tire players more and what less...

If you want to help make this gameplay as good as possible, please read the text to the end.

What Football4Life would like you to pay attention to:

1. What is your impression of the controls (passes, long passes, through balls, shots...) - do they provide enjoyment during the game? Football4Life expect them to be fluid and such that it is possible to do what you want, but they should also leave a small possibility of making a mistake.
2. How does the computer play? Does the CPU use everything that is used in real life - dribbling, long shots, tika-taka, passing the ball back...
3. Does the game look scripted, or does it resemble real matches?
4. Free kicks. Football4Life tried to make them harder than the default. Bar should charge faster when shooting from close range, and slower when shooting from a distance. Also here there is a possibility of mistakes depending on the ability, mood, and fatigue of the player.
5. Is there a difference when you play against stronger and weaker teams?
6. How do you like fouls? Is there a good relationship between fighting for the ball and fouls?
7. Do the players get tired fast enough, too fast, or too slow?
8. Please mention:


    - if you are playing FUMA, or with default settings,
    - what difficulty you are playing,
    - how many matches have you played... are there only 1-2, or 10+?

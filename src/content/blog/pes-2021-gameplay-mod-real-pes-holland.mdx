  ## The new gameplay mod from Holland called "Real PES" for PES 2021
  
  <hr />

### Changelog

IT'S ESSENTIAL TO DELETE ALL THE FILES OF OTHER GAMEPLAY MODS TO FULLY SEE THE IMPLEMENTED NEWS, DON'T FORGET THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!

KNOW THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE A MODIFIED EDIT/DB..........BUT I IMAGINE YOU ALL DO, MAY NOT SEE THE SAME RESPONSES WE ARE SEEING!!!

To fully express its potential, this new project must necessarily have all the ORIGINAL KONAMI files.
There are no changes made, because that basically PES 2021 is of excellent workmanship, what was needed was just to balance
some dynamics and some game behavior, but there are many aspects on including a dll file for the gameplay, and another with a series
of information for the game to read:

The COM must play slowly and thoughtfully and must continuously vary the game actions, making it unpredictable towards the user player.

Defending COM Pass Accuracy 50%.

COM pass accuracy in midfield 40%.

COM pass accuracy in attack 30%.

COM shooting accuracy 40%.

User player ball control 100%

Ball Control COM 30%

The user player must have an advantage over the COM in advances and contrasts, and must continuously present himself in space to attack and free himself from the COM's markings. <br />
The COM does not have to be aggressive.<br />
More density in midfield.<br />
The full backs must close the flanks.<br />
Players must meet the ball when receiving it.<br />
Better ball protection for the user player and worse ball protection for the COM.<br />
The tackles must always give different trajectories to the ball, sending it into empty spaces where the players will go and conquer it, making the game dynamics always unpredictable.<br />
The referees must be more strict and sanction with more yellow cards and red cards.<br />
The refereeing metrics must be fair.<br />
User player players are more responsive<br />
Catch up bug disabled.<br />
The user player must have an advantage in headers compared to the COM.<br />
The responsiveness of the user player must be greater than the COM.<br />
The defensive phase must be stronger than the offensive phase.<br />
More variety on the corners.<br />
More variety on free kicks.<br />
COM commits more fouls.<br />
All COM players must follow the action and cover the spaces.<br />

And more.........................<br />

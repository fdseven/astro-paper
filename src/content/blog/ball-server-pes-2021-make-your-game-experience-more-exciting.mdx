### Quick Start section:

**How to use:**

1. Installing Ball Server for the first time: Unpack the v1.1 7z archive and copy unpacked folders content and modules inside your sider folder (folder where you have sider.exe file) - overwrite, if asked

   <br />
   Upgrading to version 1.1 and/or using various ballpacks already: Unpack the **v1.1
   7z** archive, delete **map_teams.txt** and **map_competitions.txt** files from
   unpacked v1.1's content folder first and then copy folders content and modules
   inside your sider folder (folder where you have sider.exe file) - overwrite, if
   asked

2. (If not done already) Download and install **CommonLib.lua** v1, download [**HERE**](https://modsfire.com/qLU7isnb42UsXDC) <br />
   Unpack v1 archive and copy the contents of the unpacked modules folder into modules folder of your sider (overwrite if asked)
   Add <br />
   `lua.module = "lib\CommonLib.lua"` as the first lua.module entry (above all others) in sider.ini file
3. (If not done already) Add <br />
   `lua.module = "BallServer.lua"` under **CommonLib.lua** in sider.ini

4. [Optional] Customize map_teams.txt and map_competitions.txt files and add more ball folders in content\ball-server folder (more instructions can be found inside .txt files)
5. [NEW v1.20] After ensuring you have a fully functional Ball Server v1.1, download and unpack v1.2 zip archive and copy unpacked folder modules inside your sider folder (folder where you have sider.exe file) - overwrite, if asked. Map files are not provided with version 1.2, only the replacement .lua script
6. [NEW v1.30] After ensuring you have a fully functional Ball Server v1.2, download and unpack v1.3 zip archive and copy unpacked folder modules inside your sider folder (folder where you have sider.exe file) - overwrite, if asked. Only the .lua script and sample versions of the two new map files are provided in v1.3 download

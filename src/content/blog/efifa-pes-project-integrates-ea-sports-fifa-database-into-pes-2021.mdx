### This is amazing PES 2021 patch from Hollywoodkills

What's the point and why?
FIFA publishes every week LIVE UPDATES with current transfers, stats changes and lineups for many leagues that are not included in PES (for example Bundesliga).
With EPP23 we can integrate a up to date database, EVERY WEEK!
To report bugs in the patch faster and easier for me to streamline you can now join the EPP Discord.

### EPP VERSION 3.0 ALL IN ONE

In this post, Hollywoodkills excited to introduce the latest version of their mod, EPP 23 Version 3. This patch seamlessly integrates the FIFA and eFootball 23 databases into PES 2021, ensuring that all transfers, squads, and player values are up to date as of November 14th 2023.
Take a look at the list below to discover the exciting new content included in this update.

Notably, EPP 23 Version 3 brings a significant change in league representation. The French Ligue 2 has been replaced by the German 2. Bundesliga, and the Russian League has been substituted with the German 3. Liga. Alongside these league adjustments, numerous players have received updates with fresh faces, and they've made sure that all teams showcase their accurate kits. However, the primary focus of this project remains on player statistics.

Over the past few months, He has diligently refined his conversion method to seamlessly integrate weekly updated FIFA stats into PES. For instance, just this week alone, FIFA underwent hundreds of updates, including modifications to Erling Haaland's stats across six distinct categories.

Looking ahead, their plan involves releasing almost weekly incremental updates for EPP, reflecting real-world football developments, such as player values, appearances, and lineups.

He would like to take a moment to express his gratitude to everyone who contributed to the patch and invested their time. Special thanks goes to **@Ben23384 , @DerRobin1 , @heywips , Mohammad, and KKSlider**.

Here's a breakdown of the Sider module and content included in the EPP 23 Version 3:

- Badge-Server
- Ballboys-Server
- Ball-Server
- BibServer
- CornerFlags
- Entrances
- FanServer
- GamePlayloader (you will need to activate it yourself in the sider.ini)
- Goalsong-Server
- IntroServer
- KitServer
- Menu-Server
- MLMyTeam
- Referee-KitServer
- ScoreBoardServer
- Weather Conditions
- Trophy-Server
- Modules and content include work by: @Hawke , @predator002 , @spursfan18 and @shentati

While they have made every effort to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the mod, there may still be some minor issues or missing content. For example, there may be some small teams that currently do not have accurate kits. If you encounter any issues or missing content, please let us know by reaching out to us on our Discord channel, and we will do our best to fix them in the next weekly update.

### Now, onto the download instructions:

He has bundled everything into an ALL IN ONE package. If you already have previous versions, he recommend deleting them all and even doing a clean installation of PES 2021.

EPP V3 is compatible with the latest PES version 1.07.2 without any crashes in BAL and ML modes.

They also provide an EDIT0000 file that contains correct tactics, but please note that this will cause the lineups in Friendly Match mode to be scrambled. So, you can either play without the EDIT file for Friendly Match mode or use the EDIT file for Master League mode.

You can find all parts of the EPP Mod V3 in a Mediafire folder. Download all parts and extract them until you have the three usual folders: Content, Modules, and livecpk.
You can either use your own Sider or download the Sider that I have provided. The most important modules are already activated in this Sider, and you can enable or disable modules and livecpk folders in the usual way by editing the sider.ini file.

If you do not like, for example, the menu music, you can either disable it by adding a ";" in front of the corresponding line in the sider.ini file or by deleting the entire folder.

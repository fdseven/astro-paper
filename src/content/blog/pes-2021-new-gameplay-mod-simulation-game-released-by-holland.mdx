  ## The new gameplay mod from Holland called "Simulation Game" for PES 2021
  
  <hr />

### Changelog

This new project uses the vanilla exe in the directory with the sole implementation of a folder to be inserted in "livecpk" (SIDER) with the relevant string
to add in sider.ini

It's a gameplay where the game construction of the CPU radically changes.
Now you will no longer notice that senseless and high-paced aggression, the CPU prefers to spin the ball looking for different solutions to go to the net.
The challenge is higher, but because now both the positioning and the reading of the CPU by the players is more intelligent, you will find yourself having to think more
to find the way to the goal because the spaces have become much smaller compared to other mods, but the satisfaction is incredible!!!
You will be able to construct actions that were precluded to you in the past, this is due to greater randomness, sometimes incorrect reading (AS IN REALITY) and controls
not always perfect but always related to the quality of the individual player.
The addresses implemented are completely new, it's a NEW GAMING EXPERIENCE!!!

### How to Install

<div class="aspect-video relative">
  <iframe
    class="absolute w-full h-full"
    width="560"
    height="315"

    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

KNOW THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE A MODIFIED EDIT/DB..........BUT I IMAGINE YOU ALL DO, MAY NOT SEE THE SAME RESPONSES WE ARE SEEING!!!

THE GAMEPLAY HAS SUFFERED A CLEAR DECLINE IN BOOST AND SCRIPTS, FOR THIS REASON I DECIDED NOT TO WORK ON THE SCRIPT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS FUNDAMENTAL
HIS PRESENCE WITHIN THE GAME, THE RISK WOULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CHALLENGE AND FUN.

  ## Gameplay mod V2.7 update for Football Life 24 by Football4Life. This gameplay can provide a lot of enjoyment to everyone

<hr />

- This time I bring you something completely different. This time I'm trying to make a football simulation, where I did my best to replicate the real-life matches (the speed of the game, the possibility for players to make a nice looking action, the possibility for players to make mistakes, harder free kicks...).
- I wanted the gameplay speed to be faster, more like in real life, where there is a lot of fighting for the ball, not fouls as soon as someone looks across another player, but also to make the refereeing fair.
- Players are responsive to commands, which opens up a lot of opportunities for dribbling and making nice and realistic, non-scripted actions.
- I hope I have achieved all this and that you will enjoy it.
- If you feel that the game is too fast when you first install the mod - it's possible that Sider didn't load it properly. Exit the game, and start it again.
- Tested only on Football Life 24!!! PES users will not be able to see what we see.

### Improvements

Version 2.7 Improvements:

- Major changes regarding defense movement, player marking, space coverage...
- Fixed an issue experienced by users using alternate controls.
